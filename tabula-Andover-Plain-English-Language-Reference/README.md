These files come from the PDF reference
(Andover-Plain-English-Language-Reference.pdf) in this directory. In
particular, these are tables extracted from pages 118 through 122,
Tables 7-1 through 7-3.

These tables do not include two common keywords, *ENDIF* and *NUMERIC*.
Those had to be added manually after the fact.
